1. The project lead role must be established as a Discord role.
2. The project leads must assume management decisions which impact the future directions of FBW as well as its direction and external communications / agreements with third parties.

4. The role must possess all FBW-related powers that are currently held by the admin team, except those related to the Discord server.
