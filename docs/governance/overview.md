# FlyByWire Simulations Operating Principles

FlyByWire Simulations is an open-source community which places focus on operating via fair and efficient
governance principles. The objective of the FBW operating principles is to outline a framework in which the group
is managed, providing reference for team members as well as the general public.

## Structure

### Steering Committee

### Team

#### Development Team

#### Media Team

#### QA Team

#### Discord Team

The Discord Team coordinates the operation of the FlyByWire Simulations Discord server, where the vast majority of
activities are conducted. That server encompasses development chats, off-topic channels, management channels and announcement feeds.

It holds the responsibility to ensure the efficient operation of the Discord server, providing a productive and
safe environment for team members and users alike to discuss FBW projects and management.

The team holds the authority to use disciplinary measures on problematic individuals who harm healthy discussion in the
community or actively hinder development.


## Operation and management

The interaction between the elements detailed above is described in the Governance Charter.
